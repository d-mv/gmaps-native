# Google Maps component for React Native

Simple, ready-to-use component for React Native, using [react-native-maps](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-maps) library. Used tutorial from [About React](https://aboutreact.com/react-native-map-example/) on how to start, but had to go through [docs](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-maps/tree/master/docs) later.
